[![Try it in WordPress Playground](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20it-WordPress%20Playground-3858e9?style=for-the-badge&logo=wordpress)](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fwp-json%2Fplugins%2Fv1%2Fplugin%2Fwc-ai-chatbot%2Fblueprint.json%3Fzip_hash%3D27be4be624dce5f524e5529f9753bded%26type%3Dpcp)

An AI-powered shopping assistant for WooCommerce. Customers can search products, get recommendations, and manage their cart through a natural chat interface — without leaving the page.

Supports **Anthropic Claude** and **Moonshot AI (Kimi K2)** with real-time streaming responses.

## Features

- **Natural language shopping** — customers describe what they want, the AI finds it
- **Full cart control** — add, view, and remove items through conversation
- **Two AI providers** — Anthropic Claude or Moonshot AI (Kimi K2), switchable from the admin
- **Real-time streaming** — responses appear word-by-word (Moonshot provider)
- **Agentic reasoning** — multi-step tool use: the AI can search, evaluate, and add to cart in a single message
- **Customisable widget** — bot name, greeting message, and accent colour
- **Optional system prompt** — inject store policies, tone guidelines, or FAQs

## Supported Models

| Provider | Models |
|---|---|
| **Anthropic** | claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-opus-4-6 |
| **Moonshot AI** | kimi-k2-thinking-turbo *(recommended)*, kimi-k2-thinking, kimi-k2.5, moonshot-v1-auto, moonshot-v1-8k/32k/128k |

---

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0+
- WooCommerce 7.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- An API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) or [platform.moonshot.ai](https://platform.moonshot.ai)

---

## Installation

1. Download `wc-ai-chatbot-1.0.0.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/fahdi/wc-ai-chatbot/releases)
2. In WordPress admin go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
3. Upload the zip and activate
4. Go to **Settings → AI Chatbot**
5. Select your provider, enter your API key, save
6. The chat widget appears on all frontend pages automatically

---

## Configuration

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| AI Provider | Anthropic (Claude) or Moonshot AI (Kimi) |
| API Key | Provider-specific key — never exposed to the frontend |
| Model | Choose speed vs capability tradeoff per provider |
| Bot Name | Displayed in the chat header |
| Greeting Message | First message shown when the widget opens |
| Accent Color | Widget header and button color |
| System Prompt | Optional extra instructions injected before every conversation |

---

## How It Works

The plugin registers two REST endpoints:

- `POST /wp-json/wc-chatbot/v1/message` — standard request/response (Anthropic)
- `POST /wp-json/wc-chatbot/v1/stream` — Server-Sent Events streaming (Moonshot)

Each request runs an **agentic loop**: the AI can call WooCommerce tools multiple times before returning a final response. Tool results feed back into the next API call automatically.

### Available Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `search_products` | Searches by keyword, category, and price range |
| `get_product_details` | Returns full product data including variations and stock |
| `add_to_cart` | Adds a product to the current session cart |
| `view_cart` | Returns current cart items and totals |
| `remove_from_cart` | Removes an item by cart item key |

---

## Development

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
composer install

# Run tests
vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
```

The test suite uses [PHPUnit 10](https://phpunit.de), [Brain\Monkey](https://brain-wp.github.io/BrainMonkey/) for WordPress function mocking, and [Mockery](http://docs.mockery.io) for WooCommerce object mocking.

```
36 tests, 117 assertions — all passing
```

## External Services

This plugin transmits conversation data to third-party APIs:

- **Anthropic** (`api.anthropic.com`) — [Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy)
- **Moonshot AI** (`api.moonshot.ai`) — [Privacy Policy](https://www.moonshot.ai/privacy)

Only the current session's conversation history and relevant product data are sent. No personal customer data is transmitted unless the customer types it into the chat.
